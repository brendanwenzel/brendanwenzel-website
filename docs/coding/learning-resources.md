# Learning Resources

The process of learning how to code can lead down way too many rabbit holes.

The following resources are sites, tutorials and other resources that have helped on my journey becoming a developer.

## Solidity Specific

### Solidity by Example

The most direct and to the point way to learn Solidity is going lesson to lesson down the list on this website.

Their [YouTube Channel called Smart Contract Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWh7F3AFyQ_x01VKzr9eyA) provides more in-depth video explanations of the lessons.

If you are learning Solidity, this should be the first website you bookmark!

### Patrick Collins' Marathon Tutorial

This monumental 32-hour full-stack training video posted on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube is hands-down one of the best foundational tutorials for anyone even remotely interested in learning how to Solidity and JavaScript to build tools.
